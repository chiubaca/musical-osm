A data visualisation that explores the use of music and geography. Whenever a new [Open Street Map edit](https://www.openstreetmap.org/) has been commited, a relaxing chime sounds and the location is pin-pointed on the map.

Heavily inspired by [Trams of Helsinki](https://codepen.io/teropa/full/mBbPEe) by Tero Parviainen.
